Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

### Like most
The fact that you can see when each and every minor change was made, by whom and why (if we have good commit messages)

### Like least
It can get out of hand so easily. I wish there was a better way of comparing two files for meaningful differences vs differences that dont even make sense to display (like jupyter notebooks, linting changes, or a rogue space character)
